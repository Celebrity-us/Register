Welcome back, Mary Holmes, to your meet and greet profile. The meet and greet itself is free. However, because you received a full ticket refund last year, you will need to purchase a new ticket.

<br><br>

For your convenience, you have a one-time offer where you can get a ticket for just $89. Since this ticket ensures you get the rare experience of connecting with Steve Perry on a deeply personal level, the discounted price of $89 for this ticket is practically the cheapest anyone has ever gotten, and it was made this cheap just for you. But note that this discounted price of $89 is only available for the next few minutes, so hurry up and get your ticket now before the price increases again.
